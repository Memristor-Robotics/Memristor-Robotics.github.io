about_text: >
  <p>Memristor is robotics team focused on research and development. It has a role to educate members and ensure development environment to enhance their skills. It brings together students from many engineering fields and
  learning them how to build fully autonomous robots and the most important teamwork.</p>

  <p>The team is founded by professors from University of Novi Sad, Serbia in 2007, the same year when the first electronic
  component <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor">memristor</a> is created. Since that year Memristor is competing on <a href="http://www.eurobot.org/">Eurobot</a> competition, each year winning one of
  first three places on national competition and achieving great results on international Eurobot competition.</p>
